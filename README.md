# paymybill.restaurant-scrape

This is a small project I worked on when I was 16 when I discovered that you could easily view what people have ordered at every table in Frankie and Benny's through the PayMyBill functionality.

After looking around a bit, I noticed that there were other restaurants using this service and wrote a little script to pull out information on what every table has currently ordered at a specific restaurant and output it in a pretty format.

I will probably come back to this when I have time and it needs a serious redo, but I'm going to leave it here for now.
